# Decisions log

Choices made during the data build that were not settled by the spec, recorded here rather
than resolved silently. Each states what was decided, what the alternative was, and what
would change the answer.

---

## 1. Outrights are identified by symbol grammar, not `instrument_class`

**The spec says to filter on `instrument_class`. It is not in this batch.** `metadata.json`
records `schema: ohlcv-1m` only — no `definition` schema, and therefore no
`instrument_class` field anywhere in the 806 data files.

**Decided:** fall back to the CME symbol grammar — `^ROOT+MONTH+YEAR$` for an outright, two
well-formed outrights joined by a hyphen for a spread — applied to all 806 files, with
anything matching neither form reported rather than guessed at. 0 files were unrecognised.

**Rejected:** a substring test for a hyphen. The crypto project's own tests reject it, in
both directions: a spread whose symbol carries no hyphen would be kept, and an outright
whose symbol contains one would be dropped. The grammar check requires both legs to parse.

**This is weaker than `instrument_class` and the report says so.** What would change it: a
new batch job requesting the `definition` schema. The parser prefers `instrument_class`
whenever it is present.

---

## 2. Contracts are keyed by `instrument_id`, and the canonical code carries a four-digit year

**CME single-digit year codes repeat every decade and this batch spans sixteen years**, so
the same symbol string names two different contracts, and `split_symbols` writes both into
one file. Measured:

| raw_symbol | instrument_id | window | price range |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NQZ5` | 12809 | 2014-09-22 .. 2015-12-18 | 3,901 – 4,739 |
| `NQZ5` | 158704 | 2024-12-27 .. 2025-12-19 | 16,873 – 26,396 |

77 symbol strings are affected. Concatenating by symbol would produce a "contract" whose
price jumps five-fold mid-series — and **no OHLC, duplicate or outlier check would catch it**,
because every individual bar is valid.

**Decided:** key by `instrument_id`; emit `contract` as `NQZ2015` / `NQZ2025`.

**The expiry year is derived, then asserted.** A contract expires at or after its last bar,
so the expiry year is the smallest year ≥ the last bar's year congruent to the symbol's year
digit mod 10. `assert_unique_contract_codes` enforces that no two contracts resolve to the
same code — and **it caught a real collision on the first run**: `MGCG8` is Feb 2028 with 214
bars from 2026-04-08, and an earlier rule that simply took the last bar's year labelled it
`MGCG2026`, which would have overwritten the genuine Feb 2026 contract on disk.

## 3. The expected-bar calendar is measured per year, not hard-coded

**The gap check is the point of the validator, and a fixed maintenance window is wrong here.**
CME moved the Globex close during this sample. A single 17:00–17:59 ET break flagged 2,029
perfectly good bars, including NQ prints of 240,000–320,000 contracts at 17:25–17:35 ET in
2010–2015 — settlement-period volume under the old schedule, unmistakably real.

**Decided:** measure the closed window per product per year from coverage, and assert its
SHAPE — exactly one contiguous closure of 45–90 minutes per year. The schedule change then
appears as a finding rather than a fault:

- MGC 2010: closed 17:15–17:59 ET (45 min) → from 2016: 17:00–17:59 (60 min)

**Acknowledged circularity:** the data defines the expectation the data is judged against.
What makes it a real check is the shape assertion, which can and does fail — NQ 2010–2015
shows *two* separate closures per year and is reported as FAIL. That is a genuine finding:
the modern single-break session model does not describe pre-2016 NQ, and any session-anchored
hypothesis on NQ before 2016 needs a different model.

**Not decided by me:** what the pre-2016 NQ intraday structure actually was. It is reported,
not adjudicated.

## 4. Absent bars are not counted as gaps

`ohlcv-1m` aggregates trades, so **a minute with no trades produces no bar at all** — measured:
0 zero-volume bars across all 15.3M. For a thin contract, absence means no trade, not missing
data. A flat every-minute expectation would report millions of false gaps.

**Decided:** report coverage; flag only what a liquid book cannot innocently produce — a
contiguous run of ≥15 absent minutes inside 09:30–16:00 ET.

**Consequence for §3 checks 5 and 6** (zero-volume runs, zero-volume-with-live-range): they
cannot fail on this dataset. They are reported as **N/A with the count**, not PASS. A check
that cannot fail must not be allowed to look like evidence.

---

## 5. The NQ→MNQ splice is licensed by a measurement, not an assumption

Verified on 25,657 matched minutes in May 2019:

- median close ratio MNQ/NQ = **1.000000000**, range 0.997640–1.002847
- median absolute difference **0.25 index points** — exactly one tick
- 63.4% of matched minutes within one tick

**Decided:** concatenate with no scaling factor. MNQ is one tenth the *notional* of NQ, not
one tenth the price.

Residual differences are microstructure: two separate books, so a minute's close is the last
trade in each and they do not trade in lockstep. The check asserts the **ratio** and reports
the difference **distribution**, so a one-tick residual cannot be mistaken for a convention
problem — and a factor-of-ten one could not be missed.

## 6. The kurtosis prediction was falsified, and the falsification is kept

`FUTURES_STRATEGY_HYPOTHESES.md` predicts index futures run "an order of magnitude lower"
kurtosis than BTC and that the 46-event DSR wall "drops to roughly 5 events".

Measured: **MGC at one minute is γ₄ = 226.5, fatter-tailed than Bitcoin's 199.9.** MNQ is
115.1 — lower by 1.7×, not ten. At 60 minutes the floor falls from 46 to 18, a real 2.6×
improvement but not the predicted tenfold one, and the lowest floor found anywhere is 10 at
180 minutes.

**Decided:** report the falsification as the headline of `reports/kurtosis.md` rather than a
footnote, and correct the "wall is gone" framing. The prediction's *direction* was right at
long horizons and wrong at one minute, which is exactly where a one-minute strategy would
live.

---

## 7. The GARCH null fit searches clustering as well as tail

**ν alone cannot reach MNQ's kurtosis.** With the inherited crypto parameters (α 0.20,
β 0.79) the generator floors at γ₄ ≈ 191 even with near-Gaussian innovations, because
volatility clustering contributes kurtosis on top of the innovation's own. A first pass
silently accepted that shortfall and tested the pipeline against a null 66% fatter than
intended.

**Decided:** fit (ν, α) jointly, holding α+β so persistence is preserved while the tail
thins, and report the **achieved** kurtosis beside the target. Both now match exactly.

**Recorded caveat:** in that first, mis-fitted pass the MGC null promoted 1 of 8. The
correctly-fitted run is 0/16. Two generators matching the same kurtosis behaved differently,
which says the result is sensitive to how the tail splits between innovation fatness and
clustering — so the §7.2 PASS is provisional until the Stage 1 bootstrap α is recalibrated
on futures moments.

---

## 8. Still outstanding, and blocking

- **The Stage 1 bootstrap α calibration is still crypto's.** CLAUDE_FUTURES.md §4 flags it;
  build-order step 8 is where it gets re-measured. Nothing quotes a Stage 1 p-value until
  then.
- **The detection floor is still crypto's 0.1592× one-minute volatility.** The §7 run here
  establishes the harness works on futures-shaped noise; it does not establish a floor.
- **No Stage 1 has been run on any hypothesis**, as instructed.
